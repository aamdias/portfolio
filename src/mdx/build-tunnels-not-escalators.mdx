# Build Tunnels, Not Escalators

___Why product-first teams should redesign how value reaches customers, not just automate the existing path___

In most companies, work happens on top of an invisible city map.

Each department is a neighborhood. Every process is a street. The way value flows to customers is the path through that city: which streets connect, which dead-end, where things get congested, and where nobody ever goes. That map, with all its limits, shortcuts, and blind spots, is the company's current hypothesis for how to deliver value.

<div className="highlight-callout">
This is important: the map is not reality. It's just how we currently believe our customers should move from point A to point B.
</div>

## The default mindset: "build me an escalator"

Most operational teams only see a tiny slice of this city.

They see the one street they walk every day: their workflow, their spreadsheets, their tickets, their handoffs. When they talk to product or engineering, the request often sounds like:

_"I do X, Y, Z every day. Can you automate this for me?"_

In other words: _"Can you build me an escalator on this exact street?"_

The assumptions underneath that request are rarely questioned:

- The current path is correct.
- The current rules and constraints are immutable.
- The only problem is speed or efficiency.

So technology becomes a factory for escalators: we take whatever exists today and make it faster, smoother, or more convenient — but fundamentally unchanged. We accept the current city map as truth and simply add power-ups on top.

This is how companies fill their product backlogs with "small improvements" that never fundamentally change how value is delivered.
</div>

## Product-first companies think in tunnels

A product-first company plays a different game.

Instead of asking "Where do we put escalators?", product teams ask "Where should the roads exist in the first place?" They are less interested in speeding up the current route and more interested in redrawing the map.

If we think of value as moving a customer from point A to point B — from their current state to their transformed state — then the obvious question is:

<div className="highlight-callout">
What is the best possible path from A to B, not just the path we already have?
</div>

Sometimes that path doesn't go through the existing streets at all. Sometimes the best solution is to dig underneath the city and build a tunnel that connects A and B directly.

Tunnels break old assumptions:

- They cut across organizational boundaries.
- They ignore legacy "this is how we've always done it".
- They often look impossible from the sidewalk level.

People deep in operations often can't even imagine the tunnel, because their whole experience is constrained to a single neighborhood. That's not their job. It is the job of product and technology to zoom out, understand the entire city, and design new infrastructure that changes what's possible.

## Tunnels vs. escalators in practice

An **"escalator" solution:**

- Automates an existing manual process.
- Keeps the same steps, rules, and handoffs.
- Makes the current experience faster, but not fundamentally different.

A **"tunnel" solution:**

- Questions whether the current steps should exist at all.
- Reorganizes responsibilities and flows across teams.
- Often removes entire streets from the map.

For example, instead of:

- Building an escalator that speeds up how an internal team retypes customer data between systems,

you might:

- Build a tunnel that lets the customer self-serve once, with the data flowing end-to-end without any retyping.

From the perspective of the operations team, this looks like magic. From the perspective of a product-first team, this is just what happens when you optimize for customer movement from A to B, not for internal comfort with the existing map.

## What it means to be truly product-first

In a product-first company, product teams are empowered — and expected — to build tunnels.

That means:

- They spend most of their time understanding the whole city: customers, operations, constraints, and opportunities.
- They are trusted to challenge local optimizations when they get in the way of global outcomes.
- Their roadmap is not a queue of escalator requests, but a set of bets on better paths from A to B.

<div className="highlight-callout">
This doesn't mean escalators are never useful. Sometimes, building a quick escalator to relieve a bottleneck makes sense. But if all you ever build are escalators, you're just accepting the current map as destiny.
</div>

A product-first culture recognizes that the real leverage comes from changing the map.

## Stop asking only for escalators

If you're in operations or any business function, it's natural to ask for help on the street you walk every day. Keep doing that — your context is invaluable.

But also ask:

- "Are we even on the right street?"
- "What would it look like if this step simply didn't exist?"
- "If we started from the customer and ignored our current org chart, how would we design this?"

If you're in product or technology, listen carefully when people ask for escalators, and then look up at the bigger map. Use those requests as signals of friction, not as the final specification.

The companies that win long term don't just move people through the same city a bit faster. They redraw the city so customers can move from A to B in ways that were previously unthinkable.

**Don't just build escalators.**

**Build tunnels.**
